The closest planet I found is Xaardam. It's mostly wasteland although i found a little city on the surface. (Engaging landing protocol.)
So what was the problem with the ship?
Alex
It looks like our hipernavigation system is down we need to find a programmer who will repair errors in the compilation.
Well, I hope I will find one here.
(You exit the ship, and you see a stranger alien with one eye looking like he's waiting for you.)

Oi, hiiii, my name is Mitsuki Suki'tsun and I'm wondering what are you doing in this godforgotten planet?
system in my ship went down, and I'm looking for a programmer that could help me fix it.
Mitsuki Suki'Tsun
What a chance! You have a lot of luck Commander! I'm a programmer myself. I've sold my workshop years ago though. It would be nice to repair something once again. Hmmm... Maybe we will play a little game and if you will answer correct to at least 2 out of 3 of my questions i will repair it for free, huh?(yes/no)
Yeah, why not, that should be fun!
You are probably only living person on this planet that knows how to handle it anyway. I guess I have to agree.
Mitsuki Suki'Tsun
Okay then. My first question is what is a factorial number out of
That is a correct answear!
You were close...
Unfortunately not at all
My second question is how much is 2 + 2?
My last question is how much is 5 * 5?
Would you want to try again?
Mitsuki Suki'Tsun
You answeared correctly to all of my questions! I will give you now this fish figure and repair your navigation system.
Well, you were close but i will repair your ship anyway.
(Mitsuki Suki'Tsun proceed to your ship and after a while he come back to you with a big smile and good news. You do a little test and start engines so you can proceed your journey through space void.)
Alex
Captain I've run a little test and it shows that there is something wrong with the ship. I will look for the closest place we could land.
